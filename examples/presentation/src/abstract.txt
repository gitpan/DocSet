by Stas Bekman,
Thursday, July 25 1:45pm - 2:30pm

Who Should Attend: 
Experienced mod_perl Programmers who want to learn what's new in the
mod_perl world. And wannabes who want to learn what they can achieve with
mod_perl 2.0. The talk will be quite technical.

Abstract:
This session will provide an overview of what's new in mod_perl 2.0 and
what else is planned for the future. Learn how mod_perl 2.0 has adjusted
to Apache 2.0's threaded architecture using new features of Perl version
5.6 to provide significant performance and memory-sharing improvements
over mod_perl's 1.xx versions. Apache 2.0 has also introduced a number of
new APIs and module hooks, this session will discuss where and how
mod_perl fits into these new areas of the server.
