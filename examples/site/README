This directory is a sample project that you can start with and then
modify it to use your files instead.

If you are located in Docset-xx directory, cd to the 'examples/site'
directory:

  % cd examples/site

It includes a shrinked version of perl.apache.org, with many docs
removed or reduced to the mininumum. There are still quite a lot of
documents left so you can see the big picture.

To build the HTML version of the site and see what it does, run:

  % bin/build -v

Without -v the build won't print anything.

Now you can see the output in the 'dst_html' directory.

To build PDF, use -d option, e.g.:

  % bin/build -vd

Now you can read one of the generated PDF books from the 'dst_ps'
directory and its sub-directories, e.g.:

  % acroread dst_ps/docs/1.0/guide/guide.pdf

or

  % acroread dst_html/docs/1.0/guide/guide.pdf

since it's copied there, so the dst_html dir is the final version that
can be published on the web and includes the sources, the htmls and
pdfs.

Normally if you modify certain files, only they will be rebuilt, but
if you change a template you may want to force a complete rebuilt with
'-f':

  % bin/build -vf

========================================

The layout of the project tree:

./src/config.conf -- the main config file that you should change

./README -- this file

Sources directory:

./src            -- the source files (pod, html, images, etc)
./src/config.cfg     -- config file
and lots of source files in various formats.

After the first run cache files will also appear in the 'src' dir and
its sub-dirs.

Templates:

./tmpl                -- templates files directory
./tmpl/custom         -- custom templates
./tmpl/std            -- standard templates libs (do not touch)

Execution scripts:

./bin/build       -- a sample script that builds the site

In the directory conf you will find sample configuration files the
behavior of html2ps:

conf/html2ps.conf        -- normal book mode
conf/hyphen.tex          -- this file is required by config files

To learn how to modify the default html2ps behavior read the
documentation at http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html. You specify
which html2ps config file to use in the config.cfg file as explained
in the DocSet::Config manpage.

If you want to build your own documentation project/site, simple start
off this example and change things to fit your content/style. For more
info read the DocSet manpages.
