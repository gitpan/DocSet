<!-- Please notice that the base element is hardcoded, to handle
correctly ErrorDocument calls, which disregards the relative to the
root position of the invalid request. So if the site is placed not
under / on a different machine, this page will not render correctly
since the stylesheets and the rest of the objects will be looked for
under / -->

<p>
The object you were looking for is not at this address anymore.
There's been a little bit of reshuffling in the documentation
hierarchy, therefore please use the main menu to find your way around.
</p>

<p>
If you still can't find what you're looking for, or if you got here
following a link within the site which should be fixed,
let us know at docs-dev (at) perl.apache.org.  Thanks!
