mod_perl 1.0 Win32 Configuration Instructions

=head1 Description

This document discusses how to configure mod_perl 1.0 under Win32.

=head1 Configuration

Add this line to F<C:\Apache\conf\httpd.conf>:

 LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so

Be sure that the path to your Perl binary (eg, F<C:\Perl\bin>) is in
your C<PATH> environment variable. If you have a C<ClearModuleList>
directive enabled in F<httpd.conf>, you may also need to add

 AddModule mod_perl.c

See the descriptions of the C<ClearModuleList> and C<AddModule>
directives in the Apache documents for more details, especially
concerning the relative order of these and the C<LoadModule>
directive.
