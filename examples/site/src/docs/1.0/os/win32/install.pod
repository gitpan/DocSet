mod_perl 1.0 Win32 Installation Instructions

=head1 Description

This document discusses how to install mod_perl 1.0 under Win32, both
in building from sources and in installing pre-compiled binary
packages.

=head1 Building from sources

You will need

=over

=item *

patience - mod_perl is considered alpha under Win32.

=item *

MSVC++ 5.0+, Apache version 1.3-dev or higher and Perl 5.004_02 or higher.

=item *

As of version 1.24_01, mod_perl will build on Win32 ActivePerls
based on Perl-5.6.x (builds 6xx). For binary compatibility you 
should use the same compiler in building mod_perl that was used 
to compile your Perl binary; for ActivePerl, this means using VC++ 6.

=back

Obtain the mod_perl sources from CPAN:

  http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DO/DOUGM/mod_perl-1.xx.tar.gz

When unpacked, using Winzip or similar tools, a subdirectory
F<mod_perl-1.xx> will be created.

There are two ways to build mod_perl - with MS Developer Studio,
and through command-line arguments to 'perl Makefile.PL'. In both
cases Apache should previously have been built and installed - if
you are using a binary build of Apache, make sure that you obtain
a binary build that includes the Apache libraries and header files.
