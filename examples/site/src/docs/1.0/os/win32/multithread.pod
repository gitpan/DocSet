Discussion of multithreading on Win32 mod_perl-1.xx

=head1 Description

This document discusses the multithreading limitations of
mod_perl-1.xx on Win32.

=head1 The problem

On Win32, mod_perl is effectively single threaded. What this
means is that a single instance of the interpreter is created,
and this is then protected by a server-wide lock that prevents
more than one thread from using the interpreter at any one time.
The fact that this will prevent parallel processing of requests,
including static requests, can have serious implications for
production servers that often must handle concurrent or
long-running requests.

This situation changes with Apache/mod_perl 2.0, which is based on a
multi-process/multi-thread approach using a native Win32 threads
implementation See the L<mod_perl 2
overview|docs::2.0::user::overview::overview> for more details,
and the discussion of L<modperl-2 in Win32|docs::2.0::os::win32::install>
on getting modperl-2 for Win32 in particular.
