mod_perl 2.0 Win32 Installation Instructions

=head1 Description

This document deals with installation specifics on Win32 platforms.

As described in the discussion of issues in L<multithreaded
win32|docs::1.0::os::win32::multithread>, a mod_perl 1.0 enabled server
based on Apache 1.3 on Win32 is limited to a single thread serving a
request at a time. This effectively prevents concurrent processing,
which can have serious implications for busy sites. This problem is
addressed in the multi-thread/multi-process approach of mod_perl
2.0/Apache 2.0.  This document discusses how to obtain mod_perl 2.0.

=head1 Installing

Apache 2.0 and mod_perl 2.0 can be obtained in two ways - either as
binaries, or through building from the sources.  As with most packages
of a more complex nature, it is best, when possible, to build things
from the sources. However, this requires some experience with using
Visual C++.
