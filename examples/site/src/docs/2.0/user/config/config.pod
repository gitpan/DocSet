=head1 NAME

mod_perl 2.0 Server Configuration



=head1 Description

This chapter provides an indepth mod_perl 2.0 configuration details.







=head1 mod_perl configuration directives

Similar to mod_perl 1.0, in order to use mod_perl 2.0 a few
configuration settings should be added to I<httpd.conf>. They are
quite similar to 1.0 settings but some directives were renamed and new
directives were added.









=head1 Enabling mod_perl

To enable mod_perl built as DSO add to I<httpd.conf>:

  LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so

This setting specifies the location of the mod_perl module relative to
the C<ServerRoot> setting, therefore you should put it somewhere after
C<ServerRoot> is specified.

If mod_perl has been statically linked it's automatically enabled.

Win32 users need to make sure that the path to the Perl binary (e.g.,
I<C:\Perl\bin>) is in the C<PATH> environment variable.
