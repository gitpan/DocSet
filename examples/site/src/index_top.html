<p>mod_perl brings together the full power of the <a
href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> programming language and the <A
href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> HTTP server.  You can use
Perl to manage Apache, respond to requests for web
pages and much more.</p>

<div class="quotation">
<span class="big-mod">mod_perl&nbsp;</span> is more than CGI scripting
on steroids.  It is a whole new way to create dynamic content by
utilizing the full power of the Apache web server to create stateful
sessions, customized user authentication systems, smart proxies and
much more.  Yet, magically, your old CGI scripts will continue to work
and work very fast indeed.  With mod_perl you give up nothing and gain
so much!

<p>
mod_perl gives you a persistent Perl interpreter embedded in your web
server.  This lets you avoid the overhead of starting an external
interpreter and avoids the penalty of Perl start-up time, giving you
super-fast dynamic content.
</p>

<p>
As you'd expect from the Perl community, there are hundreds of
modules written for mod_perl, everything from persistent
database connections, to templating sytems, to complete
XML content delivery systems.  Web sites like
<A href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and
<A href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired Magazine</a> use mod_perl.
