<h1>mod_perl is the marriage of Apache and Perl</h1>

mod_perl brings together two of the most powerful and mature
technologies available to the web professional today.

<br><br>

Simply <a href="../download/">install</a> mod_perl
and you have the <b>full power</b> of the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache Web Server</a>
at your fingertips:


<blockquote>

    <a name="registry"></a>
    <br><br>

    <b>Accelerate your existing dynamic content</b>
        <blockquote>
            The standard Apache::Registry module can provide 100x speedups for your
            existing CGI scripts and reduce the load on your server at the same
            time. A few changes to the web server's config is all that is required
            to run your existing CGI scripts at lightning speed.

    <a name="handler"></a>
    <br><br>

    <b>Easily create custom modules that become part of Apache</b>
        <blockquote>
            With mod_perl writing custom modules to extend and
            enhance Apache is a snap.  Content handlers can be written in just
            a few lines of code and can be quickly integrated with existing
            modules specifically designed for use with mod_perl, or with
            modules freely available from the <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.

    <a name="stages"></a>
    <br><br>
    
    <b>Gain access to all request stages</b>
        <blockquote>
            mod_perl is not only about super fast content generation.
            With mod_perl all phases of the request cycle can be accessed
            and controlled.  No other web acceleration product gives you this
            much control.

            <br><br>
            Imagine the flexibility of rewriting URLs using Perl!
            Rewrite URLs based on the content of a directory structure, settings
            stored in a relational database, or the phase of the moon.

            <br><br>
            Write custom authentication and authorization modules to integrate with
            existing user databases or take advantage of the well-supported CPAN
            modules to extend the abilities of Apache. You can even create custom
            logging tailored to your site's specific needs.

    <a name="config"></a>
    <br><br>
            
    <b>Configure Apache with Perl</b>
        <blockquote>
            Perl can be used right in your httpd.conf file.  Everything from virtual hosts
            to authentication settings can be configured via Perl.  URL translation logic
            can be written with Perl for your complex or dynamic URL rewriting needs.
            Settings can be adjusted on a per-request basis and values passed from code
            in httpd.conf to your content generation modules.
            You can even generate complete HTTP output from the httpd.conf
            configuration file.

    <a name="modules"></a>
    <br><br>

    <b>Install Third-party modules</b>
        <blockquote>
            Third-party modules give you application functionality such as
            <b>sessions</b>, <b>passwords</b> and <b>database integration</b>.
        </blockquote>

    <br><br>

    <b>Application Frameworks</b>
        <blockquote>
            There are many high-level packages built on top of the mod_perl infrastructure
            to help you develop scalable and easily managed dynamic sites.
            All are well supported and maintain a loyal group of users.

            <br><br>
            You can select from a number of templating systems or application frameworks
            for use with mod_perl.
            See the mod_perl <a href="../products/app-server.html">Products</a> section for more
            information.
        </blockquote>


    <br><br>
        
    <b>Apache 2.0 support</b>
        <blockquote>
            With mod_perl you can take advantage of the features of Apache 2.0.
            For example, custom protocol handlers can be written in Perl.
        </blockquote>

    <br><br>

    <b>Active Support Community</b>
        <blockquote>
            mod_perl has all the support anyone could ask for.

            <br><br>
            Response time to questions posted on any of the mod_perl related
            <a href="../maillist/index.html">lists</a> is often measured in minutes.  And
            with such a large installed base there's often someone that knows
            the answer to your specific question.
            In addition, a wealth of well maintained documentation is
            available online through this web site.
            For off-line, spend your time with excellent
            <a href="../docs/offsite/books.html">books</a> about mod_perl.
            There's nothing like curling up in bed with a good book.  Or someone that's read one.
